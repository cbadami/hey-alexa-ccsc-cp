## Overview

Learn how to design and create engaging cutting-edge apps! 
We’ll intro-duce principles of designing apps that apply freely available conversational AItools (e.g., Alexa, Google Home, and Siri) [2]. 
We’ll explain the powerful andeasy ‘serverless’ functions that power them - no programming experience re-quired! 
We’ll introduce cloud computing and show the benefits of serverlessfunctions [1]. 
Along the way, participants will open an Amazon Web Servicesaccount and get started as an Alexa developer for free!
We’ll show how to use AWS Lambda to run code without worrying aboutservers, complex file transfers, or setup. 
We’ll show you how to easily uploadand edit simple web-enabled functions. 
You’ll learn how Alexa can be used toillustrate basic programming concepts like programming flow and enumeratedtypes. 
Participants get access to the project code for the reference app, check-lists for working through the steps to publish, and if they like, can leave witha newly submitted Alexa skill customized for their organization or institution.
