# Workshop 02 - Introducing Alexa Skills (20 minutes)

   - Alexa Developer Account & [Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask)
   - One Skill Invocation 
   - Many Interactions/Intents (Slots help with choices e.g, home vs away)
   - Endpoints (serverless functions with custom logic)

---

## Invocation - One Skill - Bearcat Buddy Football

- Invocation: bearcat buddy football
- User says: "Alexa, open Bearcat Buddy Football"

---

## Interaction - Many Intents


We will create two custom intents (two basic tasks our skill can handle).

1. Next Intent  (asking about next game)
2. Remaining Intent (asking about how many remain)

The first, our custom "Next Intent" asks about the next event - utterances might include:

- "When is the next home game?"
- "When is the next away game?"
- "When is the next {Location} game?"
- "Where is the next {Location} game?"
- "Next game?"

The second, our custom "Remaining Intent" asks about remaining events - utterances might include:

- "How many home games remaining?"
- "How many away games remaining?"
- "How many games remaining?"
- "How many {Location} games are there?"
- "How many {Location} games are left"
- "How many more games are there?"
- "Remaining games?"

Also: Five Amazon Built-In Intents (No Work Required)

- Intents / AMAZON.FallbackIntent
- Intents / AMAZON.CancelIntent
- Intents / AMAZON.HelpIntent
- Intents / AMAZON.StopIntent
- Intents / AMAZON.NavigateHomeIntent

Intent SLOTS enable Enumerated Types (e.g. home/away)

- In the intent, create an intent "slot" - in this case, "{Location}". 
- We create a "slot type" with possible values (home/away)

- Slot Type = LocationSlotType 
  - Value "home"
  - Value "away"

Slots make it more efficient to define sample utterances.

## Endpoints - Where the Magic Happens (Logic to handle requests) 

Serverless endpoints (URLs) to handle requests (launch, intents, end)

- Launch Request Handler (start)
- SessionEnded Request Handler (end)
- Next Intent Handler
- Remaining Intent Handler
- Help Intent Handler
- CancelAndStop Intent Handler 
- Error Handler
- Lambda Handler (no name entry point)
