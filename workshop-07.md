# Workshop 07 - Working through Alexa Code Tasks (30 minutes)

1. Design your (endpoint) code
2. Implement your code
3. Test your code

## Design (Endpoint Code)

Two files required:

1. index.js (already created)
2. games.json (create a new empty file)

One has our logic, one has the game data. Google to find the upcoming games for your favorite team.

## Implement (Endpoint Code)

### Code index.js

Modify the default code provided using the example.

1. Require the sdk (at the top)
2. Configure your constants (second section)
3. Require the games.json data file
4. Copy the helper function to "get next" 
5. Copy the helper function to "get remaining" 

Verify the handlers.

1. LaunchRequestHandler (on start) - update speakOutput if desired
2. NextIntentHandler - the first of our custom Intent Handlers
3. RemainingIntentHandler - the second of our custom Intent Handlers
4. HelpIntentHandler - update speakOutput if desired
5. CancelAndStopIntentHandler - update speakOutput if desired
6. FallbackIntentHandler - update speakOutput if desired
7. SessionEndedRequestHandler (on end)
8. IntentReflectorHandler - for debugging only (included LAST)
9. ErrorHandler - update speakOutput if desired

Remove any unnecessary [built-in](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/standard-built-in-intents.html) handlers.

Customize the constructor.

```Node
/**
 * This handler acts as the entry point for your skill, routing all request and response
 * payloads to the handlers above. Make sure any new handlers or interceptors you've
 * defined are included below. The order matters - they're processed top to bottom 
 * */
exports.handler = Alexa.SkillBuilders.custom()
    .addRequestHandlers(
        LaunchRequestHandler,
        NextIntentHandler,  //  add custom intents and remove any unnecessary ones (e.g. hello world)
        RemainingIntentHandler, //  add custom intents and remove any unnecessary ones (e.g. hello world)
         // HelloWorldIntentHandler,
        HelpIntentHandler,
        CancelAndStopIntentHandler,
        FallbackIntentHandler,
        SessionEndedRequestHandler,
        IntentReflectorHandler, // make sure IntentReflectorHandler is last so it doesn't override your custom intent handlers
    )
    .addErrorHandlers(
        ErrorHandler,
    )
    .lambda();
```

### games.json

Add a new empty file, copy in the sample data. Customize the data with your schedule. Be careful with syntax.

## Test Your Code 

Go to code, make sure your current version has been saved (click "Save") and then deployed (click "Deploy"). 

Steps:

1. Go to Test tab.
2. Set "Skill testing is enabled in:" to Development.
3. Type or say "open bearcat buddy football".
4. Listen to response.
5. Type or say "When is the next game?"

## Debugging

Errors?  Go back to the "Code" tab - it will mark syntax errors with an "X" and warnings, too. 

Address any issues. Use the sample code for examples.

After fixing, click "Save", then "Deploy" to retest.
