## Conversational AI with Alexa

Our example app and why it was needed - a skill to help find out when and where our Northwest Missouri State University football games will be. 

How we can use this example to build a similar scheduling skill for:

- Conference schedules
- Finals schedules
- Other sports teams (Bearcat Buddy - Men's Basketball, Bearcat Buddy - Women's Basketball)

Be thinking about your possible application - we'll work through this example first and later, will build our own. 

## Key Ideas / Vocabulary

- One Skill - your app name (unique) "Bearcat Buddy Football"
- Many Intents - things your user wants to do "Next Game", "Number Remaining"

## Development Process

1. **Plan** our Alexa Skill
2. **Build** - Configue the Skill & Interaction
3. **Code** - the "behind the scenes" logic 
4. **Test** 
5. Optional: Certify and Deploy

## Environment

1. Alexa Skills Kit Developer Console (to configure the skill)
2. Serverless functions (provide our custom logic)
