# Workshop 08 - Testing New Skills (20 minutes)

> After coding your handlers, it's easy to test your new skill.

## Testing 

Go to code, make sure your current version has been saved (click "Save") and then deployed (click "Deploy"). 

Steps:

1. Go to Test tab.
2. Set "Skill testing is enabled in:" to Development.
3. Type or say "open bearcat buddy football".
4. Listen to response.
5. Type or say "When is the next game?"

## Debugging

Errors?  Go back to the "Code" tab - it will mark syntax errors with an "X" and warnings, too. 

Address any issues. Use the sample code for examples.

After fixing, click "Save", then "Deploy" to retest.
