# Workshop 06 - Working through Alexa Task List (30 minutes)

1. Design your skill
2. Build your skill
3. Test your skill
4. Certify and publish your skill

## Design your skill

1. How will you invoke your skill? e.g., Alexa - open Bearcat Buddy Football. Don't be too general! Many sports in one skill is too complex - be specific. 
2. What custom intents will this skill handle? (In our case, NextIntent and RemainingIntent.)
3. For each intent, what utterances (what might the user say)?
4. Could the utterances (prompts) use any slots? (Yes - a location slot could be either home/away or omitted). 
5. For each slot (e.g. {Location}), create a slot type and list the associated values (home or away). 


## Build your skill


## Test your skill


## Certify and publish your skill
