# Workshop 06 - Working through Alexa Build Tasks (30 minutes)

1. Design your skill
2. Build your skill

## Design - Fill in these questions first! 

1. How will you invoke your skill? e.g., Alexa - open Bearcat Buddy Football. Don't be too general! Many sports in one skill is too complex - be specific. 
2. What custom intents will this skill handle? (In our case, NextIntent and RemainingIntent.)
3. For each intent, what utterances (what might the user say)?
4. Could the utterances (prompts) use any slots? (Yes - a location slot could be either home/away or omitted). 
5. For each slot (e.g. {Location}), create a slot type and list the associated values (home or away). 
6. Your skill NAME should be the invocation but with proper captilazation (e.g. Bearcat Buddy Football).
